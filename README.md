📝 Overview
This project processes a dataset (Corona.csv) containing COVID-19 statistics such as:
- Total confirmed cases
- Deaths
- Recoveries
- Tests conducted

✅ Features
- Data Cleaning: Handles missing values and ensures data consistency.
- Statistical Analysis: Computes descriptive statistics and aggregates data by continent.
- Visualizations: Line graphs, bar charts, heatmaps, pie charts.
- Error Handling: Robust exception handling for file operations.

⚙️ Requirements
Install the required Python libraries:
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

🚀 Usage
1. Place the Corona.csv file in the same directory as this script.
2. Run this script in a Python environment:
    python covid_analysis.py

🧮 Data Analysis and Code
1.The following steps were performed to analyze the COVID-19 dataset:
2.Load the Dataset: The Corona.csv file is read into a DataFrame.
3.Handle Missing Values: All missing entries are filled with zeros to ensure consistency in analysis.
4.Generate Summary Statistics: Descriptive statistics and missing value counts are computed to understand data distribution and quality.
5.Group by Continent: Data is aggregated by continent to calculate total confirmed cases and deaths.
6.Calculate Death Rate:
The global COVID-19 death rate is calculated using the formula:
Death Rate = (Total Deaths ÷ Total Confirmed Cases)
**This provides a measure of the pandemic's severity worldwide.

📈 Insights
1. Europe: Highest percentage of confirmed cases (~37.3%).
2. North America: High death rate despite moderate confirmed cases.
3. Australia: Low confirmed cases and deaths — likely due to strict measures.
