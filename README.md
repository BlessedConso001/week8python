📝 Overview
This project processes a dataset (Corona.csv) containing COVID-19 statistics such as:
- Total confirmed cases
- Deaths
- Recoveries
- Tests conducted

✅ Features
- Data Cleaning: Handles missing values and ensures data consistency.
- Statistical Analysis: Computes descriptive statistics and aggregates data by continent.
- Visualizations: Line graphs, bar charts, heatmaps, pie charts.
- Error Handling: Robust exception handling for file operations.

⚙️ Requirements
Install the required Python libraries:
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

🚀 Usage
1. Place the Corona.csv file in the same directory as this script.
2. Run this script in a Python environment:
    python covid_analysis.py



📈 Insights
1. Europe: Highest percentage of confirmed cases (~37.3%).
2. North America: High death rate despite moderate confirmed cases.
3. Australia: Low confirmed cases and deaths — likely due to strict measures.
